### 🚀 About Me

I'm a digital strategist with the soul of a software engineer. From a fullstack freelancer in RJ to an international consultant on high-impact projects in the US and Europe, I've built scalable systems, robust data pipelines, and user experiences that truly convert.

Today, my focus is on transforming my technical background into automated and scalable digital products, combining **automation, data, and storytelling**. The goal is clear: freedom, scale, and global impact 🌍.
