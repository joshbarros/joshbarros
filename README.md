Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web and mobile developer with extensive experience in creating robust and scalable solutions. I'm passionate about learning new technologies, not just for work but also as a hobby. My current tech stack includes PHP, JavaScript, and Java, and I'm currently expanding my skills with Golang in my free time.

âš¡ Technologies
Here are some of the technologies I'm proficient in:

Languages: PHP, JavaScript, Java.
Web development: HTML, CSS, React, NextJS, Node.js, NestJS.
Mobile development: React Native, Android.
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

ðŸŽ® Hobbies
When I'm not coding, I love to indulge in some RPG video games like Dark Souls, Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts.
I find that the immersive worlds and intriguing storylines are a great way to unwind and refresh my mind.
